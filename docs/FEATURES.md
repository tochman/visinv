    - New invoice date (today)

  - For sent/paid/overdue invoices, show "View" button instead
  - View mode shows all invoice data in read-only format
  - Clear visual distinction between editable (draft) and locked (sent) invoices
- **List View Changes:**
  - Draft invoices: Pencil icon → "Edit" (opens edit modal)
